// Pololu #3542 Romi Encoder connected to Pololu #3543 Motor Driver and Power Distribution Board
//   This connects motor, power, encoders, and grounds.  Kit includes this hardware.  See images.
// Sever VPU = VREG jumper on Motor Driver and Power Distribution Board and connect VPU to 3.3V.
//   This is necessary because MSP432 inputs are not 5V tolerant.
// Left Encoder A connected to P8.2 (J5)
// Left Encoder B connected to P9.2 (J5)
// Right Encoder A connected to P10.4 (J5)
// Right Encoder B connected to P10.5 (J5)

// Sever VCCMD=VREG jumper on Motor Driver and Power Distribution Board and connect VCCMD to 3.3V.
//   This makes P3.7 and P3.6 low power disables for motor drivers.  0 to sleep/stop.
// Sever nSLPL=nSLPR jumper.
//   This separates P3.7 and P3.6 allowing for independent control

// Pololu ground connected to all three Pololu #136 GP2Y0A21YK0F grounds and MSP432 ground (J3.22)
// Pololu ground connected to negative side of all three 10 uF capacitors
// MSP432 P9.0 (J5) (analog input to MSP432) connected to right GP2Y0A21YK0F Vout
// MSP432 P4.1 (J1.5) (analog input to MSP432) connected to center GP2Y0A21YK0F Vout
// MSP432 P9.1 (J5) (analog input to MSP432) connected to left GP2Y0A21YK0F Vout

# TI-RSLK-Texas-Instruments-Robotics-System-The-Maze-Edition
 The ultimate goal of the learning kit is to design, build, and test a robot system capable of solving complex tasks.Example challenges include exploring a maze, racing autonomously, finding an object, and following a line. However, it is not the final robot that matters, but the educational journey that discovers a wide range of engineering principles along the way. Rather than just providing the robot kit and a challenge to solve, this curriculum follows an educational road map that intentionally exposes deep learning along the way.
